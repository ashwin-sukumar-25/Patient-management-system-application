# üè• Patient Management System Application

### A Java-based micro-project for efficient patient management with Text-to-Speech functionality

## üìú Project Overview

This **Patient Management System** is a Java-based application designed to simplify and streamline patient management in healthcare facilities. The application allows for the efficient handling of patient records, appointments, and other crucial data, with a focus on simplicity and performance.

### Key Features:
- **Java-based Application**: Developed entirely in Java for cross-platform compatibility.
- **MySQL Database Integration**: Utilizes MySQL to store and manage patient records efficiently.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: MySQL Connector (JDBC) is used to establish a seamless connection between the application and the database.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Implemented with **FreeTTS.jar** to enable text-to-speech functionality for patient details.
- **Executable File**: The project has been compiled into `.exe` for easy execution on Windows platforms.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The project comprises the following main files:

1. **PatientManagementSystem.exe**: The executable version of the application for Windows users.
2. **PatientManagementSystem.jar**: The Java archive file, which can be executed on any system with Java installed.
3. **PatientManagementSystem.xml**: Configuration or data file required for application setup.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core language used for building the application.
- **MySQL**: For database management of patient data.
- **JDBC (MySQL Connector)**: For database connection and interaction.
- **FreeTTS.jar**: For text-to-speech conversion, providing audio feedback.
  
## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Ensure you have JRE installed on your system.
- **MySQL Database**: The application requires a running instance of MySQL.
- **JDBC Driver**: Ensure the `mysql-connector-java.jar` is available in the classpath.

### Steps to Run:

1. **For Windows Users**:
   - Simply double-click the `PatientManagementSystem.exe` to launch the application.

2. **For Java Users**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Run the following command to start the application:
     ```bash
     java -jar PatientManagementSystem.jar
     ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Make sure you have MySQL running.
   - Import the necessary database schema (provided in the project repository or available in the `.xml` file).
   - Update the JDBC connection settings if necessary.

## üó£Ô∏è Text-to-Speech Functionality

The application uses **FreeTTS.jar** for converting patient information into speech, providing an accessible interface for users who prefer or require auditory feedback.
